        <p style="text-align: left;">Our company does not use your personal data for purposes other than to provide our
            services nor do we provide the data to other individuals or companies. In cases where sharing your data to our
            partners is necessary to provide better services, we ask for your consent after notifying you of who we are
            providing it to, the purpose of sharing the information, the type of data provided, where it will be used, and
            for how long they will hold the data.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However, please note that we may provide data to third parties without your consent due
            to regulatory requirements.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This includes cases where you, the user, have provided consent to disclose or provide
            your personal data to a third party. In such a case, you may refuse to provide your data, but this may partially
            or completely limit your use of our services.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Procedures</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; After the personal data you input such as when you subscribe to our
            service has fulfilled its purpose, it is moved to a separate DB (if it is a paper document, it will be moved to
            a filing cabinet). The data will be stored for a certain period (refer to the section on Use and Duration of
            Personal Data Storage) and will be destroyed after the period expires in accordance with internal policies and
            applicable laws on data protection.</p>

            will be destroyed by means of a shredder or incinerator.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Consigned Handling of Personal Data</strong></p>

            need to consign the handling of your data to an external party to provide better services in the future.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; B. In case data handling is outsourced to another party, we will clearly
            define terms in the consignment contract to ensure the external handler follows rules/regulations on information
            security, maintain confidentiality, refrain from providing the data to third parties, and take responsibility
            for any accidents which may occur, and keep a copy of the contract as proof either in paper or electronic form.

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. Technical and Managerial Measures for the Protection of Personal
                Data</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our company has established the following technical and managerial measures to ensure
            the stability of the personal information we handle by preventing leaks, theft, loss, destruction, or damage of
            the data.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Encryption of Personal Data</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Personal data is protected by passwords. We protect data during storage
            and transmission through the employment of encryption technology.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; B. Technical Measures against Attacks such as Hacking</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; We are doing our best to prevent your personal data from leaks or
            destruction through hacking or viruses. To prevent loss or damage, your personal data is frequently backed up.
            We also use the latest vaccine programs to prevent data leaks and damage from malicious software such as virus.
            In order to ensure secure transfer of personal information, we use encryption software when transmitting data
            over the network.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, we use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our server
            and do our best to place all possible forms of technical mechanisms to ensure the security of our system.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; C. Minimizing Human Handling of Personal Data and Employee Training on
            Data Handling</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Our company limits the number of people who has access to personal data
            to only a few employees. Through training of data handlers, we are able to increase their awareness on the
            importance of personal data protection.</p>
